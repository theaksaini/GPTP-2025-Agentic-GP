***Agentic GP: A Theoretical Framework for the Development of Genetic Programming Systems via Agentic AI***

---

## Abstract

> Genetic Programming (GP) systems are composed of several core components, such as solution representation, parent selection strategies, and variation operators. While many GP systems exist, they are often tailored to specific problem domains. In cases where the existing systems do not generalize to novel tasks, users must assemble new GP systems by selecting or designing each component. This typically involves evaluating multiple alternatives for each element of the algorithm, and if no suitable option exists for a particular component, implementing a custom one from scratch. Even when appropriate components are available, users must still determine effective parameter settings tailored to the new domain. In this chapter, we propose a theoretical framework for automating this design process. We introduce Agentic GP, a framework in which multiple AI agents, specializing in different GP components, collaborate to build GP systems from scratch based on user-defined requirements. We first describe a general version of the framework applicable to any class of AI agents, and then focus on how that framework can be instantiated using Large Language Model (LLM) agents. We also implemented a simple prototype of the framework using an LLM agent designed to generate selection methods for a given GP system.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

* `experiment1_responses/`: Code segments generated by the LLM in Experiment 1, used to calculate the proportion of valid selection methods.
* `experiment2_valid_responses/`: Valid selection methods generated by the LLM for use in the AGP1 and AGP2 conditions.
* `experimental_results/`: Results from running GP using the selection methods studied in the paper.
* `agp1_annotated_responses.pdf`, `agp2_annotated_responses.pdf`: Annotated selection methods used in AGP1 and AGP2, categorized by type (e.g., elitism, fitness-proportionate).

## üîÅ Reproducing the Experiments

To replicate the results presented in the paper, follow these steps:

### 1. Environment Setup

* Create a new Conda environment with Python **3.10.18**.
* Install required packages:

  ```bash
  pip install numpy==2.2.6 ollama==0.5.1
  ```

### 2. Run the LLM Server

Start the LLM server with:

```bash
ollama run llama3.1
```

This will default to downloading and running the 8B parameter version.

### 3. Run the Experiments

#### ‚úÖ Experiment 1:

Uncomment the relevant lines for **Experiment 1** in `main.py` and comment out the rest, then run:

```bash
python main.py
```

#### ‚úÖ Experiment 2 (Step 1):

Uncomment the relevant lines for **Experiment 2 (Step 1)** and comment out the others:

```bash
python main.py
```

#### ‚úÖ Evaluate Selection Methods:

For each selection method (e.g., `lexicase`, `tournament`), run:

```bash
python main.py <method_name>
```

### 4. Analyze the Results

Use `analysis.py` to process and visualize the results:

```bash
python analysis.py
```
